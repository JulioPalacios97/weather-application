# weather-application

in this application we are using the [OpenWeather] API to know the weather of a city.

in order to run the application we need to execute the command:

### npm init

to install the necessary project dependencies.

In order to use the api, you need to first register on the OpenWeather website:

# https://openweathermap.org/

then you go to the API keys part and there you generate a new key, you copy the key it gives you and paste it in the "Key.js" file.
